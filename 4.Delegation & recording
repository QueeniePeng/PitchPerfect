Quiz: What Does The AVAudioRecorder Code Do?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import UIKit
import AVFoundation

var audioRecorder: AVAudioRecorder!

let dirPath = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(.documentDirectory,
.userDomainMask, true)[0] as String

let recordingName = "recordedVoice.wav"
let pathArray = [dirPath, recordingName]
let filePath = NSURL.fileURL(withPathComponents: pathArray)
print(filePath!)

let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
try! session.setCategory(AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord)

try! audioRecorder = AVAudioRecorder(url: filePath!, settings: [:])
audioRecorder.isMeteringEnabled = true
audioRecorder.prepareToRecord()
audioRecorder.record()

1. Find the local document directory
2. Name the recorded file
3. Set and config the audio session category and mode
4. Record


Adding Delegation To RecordSoundsVC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember that protocols act as a kind of contract. AVAudioRecorder does not know
what classes you have in your app. However, if you say that your class conforms
to the AVAudioRecorderDelegate protocol, then it knows it can call a specific
function in your class.

The specific function has been defined in the protocol (in this case, the
AVAudioRecorderDelegate protocol). This way your class and the AVAudioRecorder
are loosely coupled, and they can work together without having to know much
about each other.

Loose coupling of classes is really useful in building interchangeable pieces
of code, and used quite a lot in iOS.
