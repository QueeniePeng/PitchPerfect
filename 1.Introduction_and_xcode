Xcode has numerous keyboard shortcuts that are worth learning. Knowing them can
help speed up your iOS development, and it saves you from having to reach over
to the mouse or trackpad.

On the Navigator Panel on the left side, the following keyboard shortcuts cycle
through the different navigators.

⌘ + 0 = Show or Hide the Navigator Panel
⌘ + 1 = Project Navigator
⌘ + 2 = Symbol Navigator
⌘ + 3 = Find Navigator
⌘ + 4 = Issue Navigator
⌘ + 5 = Test Navigator
⌘ + 6 = Debug Navigator
⌘ + 7 = Breakpoint Navigator
⌘ + 8 = Report Navigator

The Utility Area on the right side of Xcode can also be toggled with the
following keyboard shortcuts:

⌥ + ⌘ + 0 = Show or Hide the Utility Area
⌥ + ⌘ + 1 = File Inspector
⌥ + ⌘ + 2 = Quick Help Inspector
⌥ + ⌘ + 3 = Identity Inspector
⌥ + ⌘ + 4 = Attributes Inspector
⌥ + ⌘ + 5 = Size Inspector
⌥ + ⌘ + 6 = Connections Inspector

If you right click (control click) on the Storyboard in the editor, then you can
select a zoom level.
You can also use 2 finger pinch in your Mac's trackpad to zoom in and out of the
Storyboard.
